#Test Plan: Input
########################################################################
driver.c tests the ability of Input.c to take either a command line
argument or user input as the filename, open the given file, and input it 
into KWIC.

driver.c begins by initializing Input.

Then, if 1 command line argument was provided to driver.c 
Input's INLoad method is called with a NULL parameter passed to it.  
Otherwise, the INLoad method is called with driver.c's argv[1] as the 
parameter passed to it.

driver.c then calls INLoad on a non-existant file (example filename:
"nonexistantfile")

driver.c then ends by returning 0.

driver.c is then used by Makefile to run all of the tests desired.  All
of the desired tests are placed in the diretory input.  For each desired
test Makefile runs driver.c with the given test's filename as driver.c's
command line argument.  It then puts actual output from driver.c in a 
directory called actualOutput and diffs it with the corresponding file
in a directory called expectedOutput.  All directories discussed above 
are stored in the same directoy Makefile is in.  If the tests above are
succesful diff should return nothing.  Otherwise, the tests failed.  

One all of the files in input have been processed the Makefile
running driver.c terminates.

The input test files described above should contain data like the 
following:

The C Programming Language
The Cat in the Hat
