Overview of LineStorage, WordTable, ShiftSort, Output
=======================================================================

General issues:

   -State invariants are no longer valid. For example, they refer to 
    data structures which are no longer in use.

   -Need to check functions and make sure ones only needed locally are
    declared static

Evan will be following up on these.

Conclusion:
    -General formatting was looked at. I attempted to keep things 
     relatively uniform with kwic-2012 and used the formatting
     that they used in terms of tab size, having a space between
     keywords and parameters, etc.
    -All functions that were declared locally have been declared static
     and put under the local functions comment header in their respective
     files
    -The state invariant of LineStorage was updated to reflect the updated
     code; the other invariants seemed to hold true upon inspection.
    -There was a pointer that needed to be updated in LineStorage
    -Took out vestigial code - old code that no longer had a use - after
     it had been modified to increase performance
