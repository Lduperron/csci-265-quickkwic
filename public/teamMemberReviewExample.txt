John Doe
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Abigale:
   I was impressed with how Abigale worked, and her composure.
I would be happy to work with her again.

Jim:
   Jim was defensive throughout the project. He would get very offened if 
one of his ideas was rejected by the team. My impression of Jim was that
he was a liability to the team and we had to baby him.

Harry:
   Harry had a very strong personality, but he was gentle and kind.
My only issue was that perhaps he would not be good at making high pressure
decisions that might negativly affect other team members.

Molly:
   I had little contact with Moly, and have no comments.

General Comments:
   I was happy with the team, although there were some issues, I was happy
with the product that we produced.
