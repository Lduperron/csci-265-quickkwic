1. System must continue to be of high quality and maintainable over time.
2. Increase kwic's run-time performance significantly.
3. Increase kwic module line-test coverage significantly.
4. Modify kwic output as follows:

Existing output format:
=======================

Input:
======
"The C Programming Language"
"The Cat in the Hat"

Old output format:
==================
C Programming Language, The
Cat in the Hat, The
Hat, The Cat in the
Language, The C Programming
Programming Language, The C

New output format:
==================
                                    The C Programming Language
                                    The Cat in the Hat

                                  The C Programming Language

Notice that the word that appeared in the first column of each line in
the old format now appears starting in column 40 of the new format.
